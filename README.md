TakeOutSimulator
A command-line Java application that simulates a food ordering system. This project demonstrates the use of Java Generics, Interfaces, Hash Maps, and User Input Handling to create a flexible and reusable codebase.

Features
Generic Food Types: Uses Java Generics to handle various food items under a unified Food type.

Interactive Menu: A dynamic interface that guides users through selecting items and placing orders.

Input Validation: Robust handling of user input to ensure a smooth simulation experience.

Modular Design: Built with multiple classes to adhere to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Technical Highlights
This project was designed to practice advanced Java concepts:

Generics: Used to ensure type safety while allowing the simulator to work with any object that extends a base food class.

Interfaces: Implemented for the ordering system logic, allowing for clean separation between the user interface and the business logic.

List & Collections: Utilized for managing the shopping bag and menu items.
